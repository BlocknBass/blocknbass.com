# What is Block&Bass?
Block&Bass is a volunteer project, ran by a team of mostly university students and DnB enthusiasts, by internationally renowned Drum and Bass producer Edlan.

The mission statement of Team Block&Bass is to build an easily expandable, easy to set up solution to host full scale Drum and Bass festivals within a Minecraft server context.

This website used to provide potential guests to Block&Bass a brief synopsis of who we are, as well as all the proprietary modifications to the game Minecraft one needs in order to be able to join the server we will use to host the event(s).
